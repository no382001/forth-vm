add string(varname,"hello world") nullterm'd
add addrofstr(varname) that works just like labels but pops the address

i should add more debugging info, like where the kernel addresses are, maybe i could actively hexdump system memory into a pipe, or print tagged memory regions 

number parsing seems to work, but im also not sure about how to test these stdlib words, should i make an include function?

-> this is all leading up to implementing the dictionary
